This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## To-Do

As any project, there are always tasks to do:

- onVideoClick is the same as onVideoPress
- style some things here and there
- separate in a component the user profile, user name and user name (gray)
- separate files in various components
- add dark mode
